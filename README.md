### Run
```git clone https://github.com/janselroa/simple-clock-powershell.git ```

```cd simple-clock-powershell```
```./test.ps1```

but before executing it we have to tell powershell to allow us to execute scripts, and for this we have to change the permissions

poweshell in admin mode

```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```

and now we can run the script

```./test.ps1```
